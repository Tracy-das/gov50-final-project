## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to human trafficking rates in the United States. I want to focus on how the U.S-Mexican boarder is one of the main transports for human trafficking compared to other boarders and countries globally. I also want to analyze the amount of human trafficking cases tehre are around the world.
